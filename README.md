# GitHub User Data Analysis from Boston

## Data Scraping Methodology
This project gathers GitHub user data from Boston, focusing on users with over 100 followers. It employs pagination (in batches) to retrieve user details and their top repositories, saving the results in CSV files for further analysis in Excel and Python.

## Interesting Insights
A surprising insight is that longer bios negatively correlate with followers. Additionally, the earliest user doesn’t have the highest follower count, indicating no first-mover advantage. While adding more repositories can increase followers, the correlation is weak.

## Recommendations for Developers
Developers should prioritize high-quality, concise content and meaningful repositories to attract more followers. They should also consider enabling both projects and wikis together for enhanced project visibility.
