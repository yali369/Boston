# GitHub User Data Analysis from Boston

## ðŸŒŸ Data Scraping Methodology
This project gathers GitHub user data from Boston, focusing on users with **over 100 followers**. It employs pagination (in batches) to retrieve user details and their top repositories, saving the results in **CSV files** for further analysis in **Excel** and **Python**.

## ðŸ“Š Interesting Insights
- A surprising insight is that **longer bios negatively correlate with followers**, the earliest user doesnâ€™t have the highest follower count, indicating **no first-mover advantage** and While adding more repositories can increase followers, but this relation is **weak**.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations for Developers
- Developers should prioritize **high-quality, concise content** and meaningful repositories to attract more followers and they should consider enabling both **projects** and **wikis** together for enhanced project visibility.
