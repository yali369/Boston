## This project gathers GitHub user data from Boston, focusing on users with over 100 followers, using pagination (in batches),  to retrieve user details and top repositories, saving results in CSV files for further analysis in excel and python.
## A surprising insight is that longer bios negatively correlate with followers, the earliest user doesnâ€™t have the highest follower count, indicating no first-mover advantage, and while adding more repositories increases followers, the correlation is weak.
## Developers should prioritize high-quality, concise content and meaningful repositories to attract more followers, and they should consider enabling both projects and wikis together for enhanced project visibility.
